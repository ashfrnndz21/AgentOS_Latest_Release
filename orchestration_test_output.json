        "raw_data_received": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem in Singapore and then regenerate it in Python. Let me start by understanding the request. First, they need a poem that's specific to Singapore. I should consider the cultural elements of Singapore, like its multicultural society, landmarks, and maybe the mix of languages.\n\nSingapore is a city-state with a blend of cultures. The poem should reflect that. Maybe use imagery related to the Marina Bay Sands, the Marina Bay Sands, the night skyline, the blend of different cultures. Also, the concept of a \"melting pot\" or \"harmony\" could be a good theme.\n\nI need to make sure the poem is structured well. Maybe use a traditional form like a sonnet or free verse. Let's go with free verse for more flexibility. The first stanza could set the scene with the skyline and the blend of cultures. Then, each subsequent stanza could focus on different aspects: languages, landmarks, traditions, and the future.\n\nFor the Python part, I need to generate the poem as a string and then convert it into a Python object. Maybe a dictionary with the poem as a string in a key. That way, the user can easily use it in their code.\n\nI should also check for any specific elements the user might want, but since they didn't mention, I'll stick to the basics. Make sure the poem is engaging and captures the essence of Singapore. Avoid any political or sensitive topics. Use vivid imagery and sensory details to make the poem come alive.\n\nNow, let me draft the poem. Start with the skyline, then move to the mix of languages, landmarks, traditions, and the future. End with a hopeful note about unity and progress. Then, in Python, store the poem as a string in a dictionary. That's the plan.\n</think>\nHi! **Poem in Singapore**  \n\nLet me know if you need any clarification!",
