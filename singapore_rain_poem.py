    "Rain in Singapore"

    Beneath the siren's cry, the sky is drenched,
    Where raindrops dance and paint the city's breath.
    The clouds, a cloak of mist, unspool their song,
    And every street is soaked in tropical song.

    The skyline, a titan of glass and steel,
    Now weeps in silver, its towers aglow.
    The rain, a painter's brush, etches the night‚Äî
    A gallery of light, where shadows meet.

    The streets, a tapestry of neon and rain,
    Reflect the world in mirrored, fleeting frames.
    The scent of jasmine, the hum of engines,
    A symphony of life, both wild and tame.

    Here, time dissolves in the storm's embrace,
    A dance of chaos, calm, and quiet grace.
    The rain, a poet, writes the city's soul‚Äî
    A paradox of modernity and grace.

    So let the storm carve its silent hymn,
    A testament to Singapore's soul.
    In every drop, a story, a dream‚Äî
    A city where the rain is both a guest and friend.
