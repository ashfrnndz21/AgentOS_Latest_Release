*  
Skyscrapers rise in golden light,  
A city where the sky meets the sea.  
From Marina Bay to Sentosa's shore,  
A rhythm of life, both bold and serene.  
*  
The tides whisper through the channels,  
A story of trade and tradition.  
The rain paints the streets in hues of green,  
A dance of life, both fast and slow.  
*  
Here, the pulse of the land is felt,  
A mosaic of cultures, bold and deep.  
From Malay whispers to Chinese flair,  
A symphony of voices, forever bound.  
*  
In every breeze, a story is told,  
A city where the world converges.  
With every step, the spirit of Singapore—  
A song of resilience, forever sung.
