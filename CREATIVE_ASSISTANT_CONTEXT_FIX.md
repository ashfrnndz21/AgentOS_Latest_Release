# Creative Assistant Context Passing Fix

## Problem Identified

The Creative Assistant is generating a fake "TASK_DECOMPOSITION ENTRY" instead of creating a funny 2-liner story based on the Weather Agent's output. This indicates that:

1. ✅ Multi-agent workflow is working (both agents selected and executed)
2. ✅ Weather Agent worked perfectly (provided detailed weather data)
3. ❌ Creative Assistant failed (generated diagnostic output instead of creative content)
4. ❌ Context passing between agents is not working properly

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The Creative Assistant is receiving this error message:
```
"ERROR: No specific task assigned to agent {agent_id} - orchestrator must provide a valid task_decomposition entry."
```

This means the task decomposition matching is failing - the Creative Assistant's agent ID is not matching any task in the decomposition.

## Debugging Changes Added

### 1. **Enhanced Context Passing Logging** (Lines 2692-2698)
```python
# Get context from dependent agents
input_context = self._get_agent_input_context(agent, agent_dependencies, agent_results, session_id)
logger.info(f"📚 Input context for {agent.name}: {len(input_context)} dependencies")
logger.info(f"📚 Agent dependencies for {agent.name}: {agent_dependencies.get(agent.agent_id, [])}")
logger.info(f"📚 Available agent_results keys: {list(agent_results.keys())}")
if input_context:
    for context_key, context_value in input_context.items():
        logger.info(f"📚 Context from {context_key}: {context_value[:100]}...")
```

### 2. **Instruction Generation Logging** (Lines 2704-2706)
```python
logger.info(f"📋 Generated instructions for {agent.name}: {len(agent_instructions)} characters")
if "Creative Assistant" in agent.name:
    logger.info(f"📋 Creative Assistant instructions preview: {agent_instructions[:200]}...")
```

### 3. **Task Decomposition Matching Debugging** (Lines 1482-1521)
```python
logger.info(f"Task decomposition for agent {agent_id}: {task_decomposition}")
logger.info(f"Available agents name->id mapping: {name_to_id}")
logger.info(f"Looking for agent_id: {agent_id}")

for task in task_decomposition:
    task_agent_id = task.get('agent_id')
    task_agent_name = task.get('agent_name')
    logger.info(f"Checking task: agent_id='{task_agent_id}', agent_name='{task_agent_name}', task='{task.get('task')}'")
    
    if task_agent_id == agent_id:
        logger.info(f"✅ Found specific task for {agent_id}: {specific_task}")
        return specific_task
    else:
        logger.info(f"❌ Task agent_id '{task_agent_id}' does not match requested agent_id '{agent_id}'")
```

## What to Look For in Logs

### **Expected Log Output for Working Fix:**

```
📚 Input context for Creative Assistant: 1 dependencies
📚 Agent dependencies for Creative Assistant: ['weather_agent_id']
📚 Available agent_results keys: ['weather_agent_id']
📚 Context from weather_agent_id: Weather Agent: As the designated Weather Agent, I have analyzed the current atmospheric conditions...

📋 Generated instructions for Creative Assistant: 1200 characters
📋 Creative Assistant instructions preview: You are the Creative Assistant.

ASSIGNED TASK: Generate a humorous 2‑line story based on the weather conditions.

============================================================
CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS AGENTS (Use this to inform your response):
============================================================
**Previous Agent (weather_agent_id) Output:**
Weather Agent: As the designated Weather Agent, I have analyzed the current atmospheric conditions...
============================================================

🔑 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION:
1. BUILD UPON the previous agent's output - don't duplicate their work
2. Your task is DIFFERENT from what they did - focus on YOUR specific assignment
3. Use their output as INPUT/CONTEXT for your specialized task
4. Do NOT repeat information already provided by previous agents
5. Your response should COMPLEMENT and EXTEND the previous work

Task decomposition for agent creative_assistant_id: [{'agent_id': 'weather_agent_id', 'agent_name': 'Weather Agent', 'task': 'Fetch weather data for Bangkok in August.'}, {'agent_id': 'creative_assistant_id', 'agent_name': 'Creative Assistant', 'task': 'Generate a humorous 2‑line story based on the weather conditions.'}]

### **Current Problematic Log Output:**

## Likely Issues to Investigate

### **1. Agent ID Mismatch**
The Creative Assistant's actual agent ID might be different from what's in the task decomposition. Common causes:
- UUID vs string mismatch
- Case sensitivity issues
- Different ID format (with/without prefixes)

### **2. Task Decomposition Format**
The task decomposition might have:
- Missing `agent_id` fields
- Only `agent_name` fields without proper ID resolution
- Incorrect data structure

### **3. Agent Selection vs Task Decomposition**
The agents selected might have different IDs than what's used in the task decomposition.

## Testing Instructions

### **1. Run the Same Query Again:**
```
"Can you tell me what the weather like is in Bangkok in Aug and then use that input to write a funny 2 liner story"
```

### **2. Monitor the Logs for:**
- Task decomposition content
- Agent ID mappings
- Context passing details
- Instruction generation for Creative Assistant

### **3. Look for These Specific Log Messages:**
- `📚 Input context for Creative Assistant: X dependencies`
- `📋 Creative Assistant instructions preview: ...`
- `✅ Found specific task for creative_assistant_id: ...`
- `❌ Task agent_id 'X' does not match requested agent_id 'Y'`

### **4. Expected Behavior After Fix:**
- Creative Assistant should receive Weather Agent's output as context
- Should generate a funny 2-liner story about Bangkok weather in August
- Should NOT generate "TASK_DECOMPOSITION ENTRY" diagnostic output

---

## Quick Fixes to Try

### **1. Check Agent ID Format:**
If the logs show ID mismatches, we may need to:
- Standardize agent ID format
- Fix the task decomposition generation
- Improve agent ID resolution

### **2. Verify Task Decomposition:**
If task decomposition is malformed:
- Check the regeneration logic in our earlier fix
- Ensure proper agent ID assignment
- Validate the task decomposition structure

### **3. Context Passing:**
If context is not being passed:
- Check dependency graph building
- Verify agent_results population
- Ensure proper context injection

  - Lines 2692-2698: Enhanced context passing logging
  - Lines 2704-2706: Instruction generation logging  
  - Lines 1482-1521: Task decomposition matching debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test query** and examine the detailed logs
2. **Identify the specific mismatch** (agent ID, task decomposition, or context)
3. **Apply targeted fix** based on the root cause found
4. **Verify the Creative Assistant** generates proper creative content
