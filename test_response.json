The user wants to calculate 5 + 3 and write a haiku. Hmm, so there are two parts here: a mathematical calculation and a poetic composition. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which agents are involved. The user mentioned available agents, but the list shows two Maths Agents and two Creative Assistants. Wait, the user listed five agents, but the names repeat. Maybe it's a typo? Anyway, the main agents here would be the Maths Agent for the calculation and the Creative Assistant for the haiku.\n\nSo, the first step is to handle the math. The Maths Agent can solve 5 + 3. That's straightforward. Then, the haiku requires creative writing. The Creative Assistant is the right choice here. \n\nNow, I need to coordinate these agents. Since the user wants both results, I should send a message to each agent. But how? The available tools include a2a_send_message. So, I can send a message to the Maths Agent to calculate 5 + 3, and another message to the Creative Assistant to write a haiku. \n\nWait, but the user might expect both results to be combined. So after getting the math result, I need to get the haiku. Then, synthesize both into a final answer. \n\nI should check if there's any context needed. The math problem is simple, so no context issues. The haiku requires the creative assistant's output. So, the steps are: send messages to each agent, collect their responses, then combine them into a coherent answer.\n\nI need to make sure the agents are properly handoff. For example, after sending the message to the Maths Agent, wait for their response, then send a message to the Creative Assistant. Then, once both have their outputs, combine them. \n\nSo the plan is: use a2a_send_message to send the math problem to the Maths Agent, get the result. Then send the haiku request to the Creative Assistant, get the haiku. Then synthesize both into a final answer. \n\nI should also check if there are any other agents needed, but the user listed five agents, but the Maths Agents are repeated.
