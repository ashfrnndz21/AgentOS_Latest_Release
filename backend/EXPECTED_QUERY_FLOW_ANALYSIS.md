## ðŸš¨ What Actually Happened vs Expected

### **Expected Flow:**
```
Frontend â†’ Backend APIs â†’ Real Agent Processing â†’ Domain-Specific Response
```

### **Actual Flow:**
```
Frontend â†’ Mock Data Generation â†’ Math/Poem Response
```

### **Root Cause:**
**Frontend-Backend Integration Broken** - Query never reached backend orchestration system

---

## ðŸ”§ Required Fixes

1. **Fix Frontend-Backend Connection** - Ensure queries reach Enhanced Orchestration API
2. **Start Text Cleaning Service** - Critical for output processing
3. **Test End-to-End Flow** - Verify complete API chain works
4. **Validate Agent Configuration** - Ensure Telco agents are properly set up

The system has all the necessary APIs and logic, but the frontend is not properly connected to trigger the backend orchestration process.
