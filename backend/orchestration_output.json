Let me start with the math part. \n\nFirst, I need to verify the calculation. 2 times 532... Well, 500 times 2 is 1000, and 32 times 2 is 64. So adding those together, 1000 + 64 equals 1064. That matches the calculator result. So the math part is done.\n\nNow, the poem. The user wants a poem. Let me think of a simple theme. Maybe something about numbers or math. Let's see. Maybe something like \"Two times five hundred and thirty-two, a result so clear, ten hundred and sixty-four, a number that's just right.\" That's a bit long, maybe. Let me make it more flowy. \n\nAlternatively, \"Two and five hundred thirty-two, a sum that's bold, ten hundred sixty-four, the answer's bold.\" Hmm, not sure. Maybe a more rhyming structure. Let's try:\n\n\"Two times five hundred thirty-two, the calculation's clear,  \nTen hundred sixty-four, the result's exact and fair.  \nA simple multiplication, yet the numbers do play,  \nA result that's right, and a poem that's quite a way.\"\n\nThat seems okay. Maybe adjust the wording for better flow. Alternatively, \"Two multiplied by five hundred thirty-two, the answer's quite a task,  \nTen hundred sixty-four, the result's not a guess.  \nA simple math problem, yet the numbers do align,  \nA poem that's written, and the result's quite a win.\"\n\nI think that works. Let me check the numbers again to make sure. 2*532 is indeed 1064. The poem should reflect that. Alright, I think that's good.\n</think>\n**Tool Execution:**\n1. Result: 1064\n\nHi! **Mathematical Calculation:**  \n\nLet me know if you need any clarification!\n\n**Creative Assistant (Step 2):**\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a poem that includes the number 1064. I need to make it creative and engaging. Let me think about how to incorporate the number naturally. Maybe use metaphors or rhymes. \n\nFirst, break down 1064. It's 1 thousand, 64. Maybe something about a journey or a journey through numbers. Rhyming couplets could work. Let's start with the first line. \"In the realm of numbers, where secrets lie, / 1064 dances, a tale to tell.\" That sets the scene. \n\nNext, mention the calculation: \"Two times five hundred thirty-two, a sum that's bold, / Ten hundred sixty-four, the answer's bold.\" That ties back to the math. \n\nThen, add a stanza about the number's significance. \"A number that's not just a count, but a spark, / A spark that lights the path through the dark.\" \n\nMaybe a stanza about the number's journey: \"From the start, it's a story of growth, / A tale of numbers, a journey of worth.\" \n\nEnd with a reflection: \"So here's to 1064, the number that's true, / A journey through math, a tale we've told.\" \n\nCheck the flow and rhyme. Make sure it's rhythmic and engaging. Let me adjust for better rhythm. Maybe tweak the lines to make them more cohesive. \n\nFinal version should be a poem that's both informative and creative, highlighting the number 1064 in a meaningful way.\n</think>\nHi! **Poem: \"The Number 1064\"**  \n\nLet me know if you need any clarification!","success":true},"selected_agent":{"capabilities":[],"description":"Specializes in solving mathematical problems, including arithmetic calculations.","id":"unknown","match_quality":"moderate","model":"unknown","name":"Maths Agent ","selection_reasoning":"Agent selected based on contextual analysis and domain matching","tools":[]},"session_id":"c2e1994b-f0a5-4fd0-bcbc-fc49d205da66","stage_1_query_analysis":{"complexity":"simple/moderate","context_reasoning":"6-Stage analysis: Calculate 2x532 and write a poem","dependencies":"None identified","domain":"Mathematics and Poetry","query_type":"general","reasoning":"Analyzed user intent, domain, and complexity to understand query requirements","required_expertise":"Arithmetic calculation, poetic composition","scope":"general","user_intent":"Calculate 2x532 and write a poem"},"stage_2_sequence_definition":{"execution_flow":"First, the Maths Agent performs the arithmetic calculation.
