## ü§ñ Step 2: A2A Sequential Handover Execution

### **Handoff #1: Orchestrator ‚Üí Telco Churn Agent**

#### **Input Context:**
```
Query: "what is the impact of the radio network pre utilisation to customer churn ? what is a high prb util that will cause user experience impact ?"
Previous Context: "what is the impact of the radio network pre utilisation to customer churn ? what is a high prb util that will cause user experience impact ?"
```

#### **Execution Details:**
- **Start Time**: 2025-09-25 00:43:06.539241
- **End Time**: 2025-09-25 00:43:46.561962
- **Execution Time**: 40.02 seconds
- **Status**: HandoffStatus.COMPLETED
- **Tools Used**: []

#### **Telco Churn Agent Output:**
```
The impact of radio network pre-utilisation on customer churn is directly tied to **user experience**. If the network is underutilised (pre-utilised), users typically experience better service quality, lower latency, and higher satisfaction, reducing churn risk. Conversely, **high PRB utilisation** (e.g., network congestion) leads to degraded performance (e.g., latency, packet loss, reduced throughput), which negatively affects user experience and increases churn likelihood.

**Key takeaway**:
- **Low PRB util** ‚Üí **High user experience** ‚Üí **Low churn**
- **High PRB util** ‚Üí **Poor user experience** ‚Üí **High churn**

Final actionable output:
**High PRB utilisation** correlates with **degraded user experience**, which drives **increased customer churn**.

### **Handoff #2: Telco Churn Agent ‚Üí Telco RAN Agent**

#### **Input Context:**
```
Query: "what is the impact of the radio network pre utilisation to customer churn ? what is a high prb util that will cause user experience impact ?"
Previous Context: "**Final actionable output:**
High PRB utilisation correlates with degraded user experience, which drives increased customer churn."
```

#### **Execution Details:**
- **Start Time**: 2025-09-25 00:44:01.204271
- **End Time**: 2025-09-25 00:44:58.299085
- **Execution Time**: 57.09 seconds
- **Status**: HandoffStatus.COMPLETED
- **Tools Used**: []

#### **Telco RAN Agent Output:**
```
**Final Answer:**
A high PRB utilisation level (e.g., >70%) in 3G networks causes degraded user experience (e.g., latency, packet loss, reduced throughput), leading to increased churn. Proactive monitoring and resource allocation are critical to prevent network congestion and maintain service quality.
